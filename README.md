# Misc

## Description
Small projects I've made in the past that don't need their own repository. These projects may be outdated or even broken.

## SourcePawn
* DodgeBall Fix - Simply sets all player's to specific models on start.
* Load Timer - Loads a timer (e.g. CKSurf) for MiniGames course maps.
* Edicts - Simply counts edicts using "sm_edicts" command.
* Locked CVars - Prints out all the CVars found in sourcemod/logs/convars.txt.
* Time Limit Logger - Logs whenever somebody changes mp_timelimit.
* Frag Radio - An updated version of Frag Radio. Uses client cookies, etc.
* TF2Ware Time Limit - Enforces time limit on TF2Ware TF2 servers.
* GFL Donators - Attempts to add a sprite over GFL Supporter's player model. I'm sure this doesn't work currently.
* GFL Dynamic Slots - Attempts to change the slot count based on the amount of players playing on the server. I am not sure if this works anymore.
* Entity Classnames - Print all entity classnames to a log file. You can filter them as well!
* DodgeBall Model - Change Decoy Dodgeball projectiles to a chicken!

## PHP
* Test Website #1 - A website I've made in BootStrap long ago. One of the first websites I've made in Bootstrap.

## Batch
* Update SM SDKs - Automatically clones the master branch of SourceMod and MetaMod along with all the branches in the HL2SDK. If they are already cloned, it will do a "git checkout" (to ensure there are no corrupted files, etc) and "git pull" (to keep the branch up-to-date).

## Bash
* Music Downloader - Uses `youtube-dl` (audio) and `ffmpeg` (volume tuning) to download videos from YouTube in the .mp3 format.

## Python
* Small Discord Bot - A small Discord bot that notifies my partner of some things at 8 AM CST in a server we have together.
